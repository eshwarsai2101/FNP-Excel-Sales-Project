# FNP-Excel-Sales-Project

This project delivers an in-depth Sales Analysis Dashboard for Ferns N Petals (FNP)—India’s
premier gifting brand—using Microsoft Excel. The objective was to derive actionable
business insights by applying data analysis, ETL techniques, and advanced Excel tools to
real-world retail data.
A structured ETL process was followed:
• Extraction from multiple raw datasets (Customers, Orders, Products, Occasions).
• Transformation using Power Query for data cleaning, normalization, and shaping.
• Loading into Power Pivot for data modelling and relationship creation across tables.
Key business questions were addressed through:
• KPI measurement (Total Revenue, Order Volume, Delivery Time, Average Spend).
• Correlation analysis to understand relationships (e.g., Order Quantity vs. Delivery
Time).
• Pivot Tables and Charts to summarize and visualize data.
• Interactive dashboard features like slicers and conditional formatting for dynamic
filtering.
Key Insights:
• Seasonal peaks in sales aligned with major festivals and occasions (Valentine’s Day,
Diwali).
• Top 5 products contributed significantly to revenue.
• Certain cities consistently generated high order volumes.
• Delivery delays increased with higher order quantities.
• Occasion-based product preferences varied significantly.
This dashboard simulates a real-world business intelligence scenario and showcases
proficiency in:
• ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) using Power Query
• Data modelling with Power Pivot
• Statistical analysis (e.g., Correlation)
• Advanced Excel formulas (VLOOKUP, SUMIFS, IF, DATEDIF)
• Dashboard design principles for stakeholder reporting
The final interactive Excel dashboard empowers FNP to make data-driven decisions, improve
delivery efficiency, and tailor sales strategies based on customer behavior and seasonal
trends.
